I need help fixing my Flutter project.

Requirements:

Tracker Forms Navigation

I have 3 trackers: Growth, Sleep, and Meal.

Each tracker has an “Add Tracker” form.

When the user saves a new entry:

The app should automatically navigate back to the corresponding Logs screen:

Growth form → GrowthLogsScreen

Sleep form → SleepLogsScreen

Meal form → FeedingLogsScreen

Please update the code so the navigation is handled correctly after saving.

General Notes

The backend is already implemented (Supabase).

I am using Cubit for state management.

I want clean, maintainable navigation logic.

Deliverables:

Updated code for:

Growth add form

Sleep add form

Meal add form

Correct navigation after saving

A short explanation of the changes

Make sure the solution works with Flutter + Supabase + Cubit.
