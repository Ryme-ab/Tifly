I have a Flutter project using Supabase and Bloc/Cubit architecture. The project has two screens where data fetching seems to not be working correctly: 

1. FeedingLogsScreen  
2. MedicationLogsScreen 
3. SleepLogsScreen
4. BabyLogsScreen 
5. StatisticsScreen 

The screens use Cubits (FeedingLogCubit, MedicationLogCubit), repositories, and data sources. The UI is working fine, but the logs are not being displayed — the Cubits do not seem to fetch the correct data from Supabase.

Here’s what you need to do:  
1. Analyze the Cubits, repositories, and data sources for both screens.  
2. Ensure the fetching logic correctly queries Supabase for the selected child. The child ID is passed to the Cubits.  
3. Ensure the Cubits emit the proper states (Loading, Loaded, Error) so the UI updates correctly.  
4. Check the mapping from Supabase rows to the model classes and make sure the data types match.  
5. Keep the UI code unchanged.  

Provide the **corrected Cubit, repository, and data source code** for both Feeding and Medication logs, with comments explaining what was fixed.  

Also, give **step-by-step instructions** on how to test the fix in the app using a test child ID.
