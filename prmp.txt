 **What I want you to do**

1. **Analyze the entire project** including:
    
    - Data layer (repositories, services, API calls, Firebase calls)
        
    - State management (Cubit/BLoC)
        
    - Models (fromJson/toJson)
        
    - UI screens that use CRUD
        
    - Any middleware or local database logic
        
2. **Identify every issue** causing:
    
    - Create not writing data
        
    - Read/fetch not returning or not updating UI
        
    - Update not saving or wrong model fields
        
    - Delete not working
        
    - Cubits not emitting states
        
    - Repository methods that never run
        
    - Incorrect async/await usage
        
    - Wrong endpoints or collection names
        
    - Model serialization mismatches
        
    - State not refreshing after CRUD operations
        
3. **Show the exact files and lines where the problems occur.**
    
4. **Fix everything directly**:
    
    - Rewrite broken methods
        
    - Fix incorrect Cubit logic
        
    - Correct models and serialization
        
    - Fix fetch logic (streams, futures, listeners)
        
    - Update UI code to react properly
        
    - Ensure all CRUD paths work end-to-end
        
5. **Explain the root cause** for each bug and how your fix solves it.
    
6. **Improve architecture** if needed:
    
    - Clean repository pattern
        
    - Consistent error handling
        
    - Proper state flows
        
    - Real-time or cached reads
        
    - Clear separation of concerns
        
7. **Run a full validation**:
    
    - Simulate Create → Read → Update → Delete for all features
        
    - Show me the logs
        
    - Confirm everything works
